# Buenos Aires Smalltalk Ecosystem

I'm a project aimed at detecting inconsistencies between the dependencies held
on the ba-st ecosystem of projects. All the projects in the ecosystem are
supposed to work alongside each other, so this project will include some
tooling to help detecting mismatched dependencies.
