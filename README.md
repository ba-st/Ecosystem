# Buenos Aires Smalltalk Ecosystem

I'm a project aimed at detecting inconsistencies between the dependencies held on the ba-st ecosystem of projects. All the projects in the ecosystem are supposed to work alongside each other, so this project will include some tooling to help detecting mismatched dependencies.
